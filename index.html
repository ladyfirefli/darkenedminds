        <p>
            Welcome to Darkened Minds, a community of passionate streamers dedicated to supporting each other’s growth

        <p>
            We believe that streaming is more than just playing games or sharing content—it's about building
            connections, inspiring creativity, and fostering an inclusive and uplifting environment. Our members come
            from all walks of life, united by a common goal: to share knowledge, offer encouragement, and celebrate each
            other's achievements.
        </p>
        <p>
            At Darkened Minds, we host events, share resources, and create opportunities for every streamer to showcase
            their unique talents. Whether you're looking for advice, feedback, or a group of like-minded individuals to
            play with, you’ll find a supportive family here.
        </p>
        <p>

        <h2>Rules of Conduct</h2>
        <p>
            At Darkened Minds, we are committed to fostering a positive, inclusive, and respectful environment for all
            members. By participating in our community, you agree to follow these rules of conduct:
        </p>

        <h3>Respect Everyone</h3>
        <p>
            Treat all members with kindness, respect, and understanding. Harassment, hate speech, or discrimination of
            any kind will not be tolerated.
        </p>

        <h3>Be Supportive</h3>
        <p>
            This community is built on the foundation of helping each other grow. Offer constructive feedback,
            encouragement, and be willing to celebrate the successes of others. Toxicity, jealousy, or tearing others
            down is not welcome here.
        </p>

        <h3>No Self-Promotion Without Engagement</h3>
        <p>
            We love supporting each other’s streams, but engagement goes both ways. Avoid spamming or only joining for
            self-promotion. Take the time to get to know fellow members and contribute to the community.
        </p>

        <h3>Keep It Friendly</h3>
        <p>
            Whether in Discord chats, voice calls, or streams, maintain a friendly atmosphere. Avoid inflammatory topics
            such as politics, religion, or anything that could cause division or discomfort.
        </p>

        <h3>Follow Streaming Platforms' Guidelines</h3>
        <p>
            Abide by the terms of service and community guidelines of platforms like Twitch, YouTube, or any other
            streaming platform. We expect all members to maintain professionalism both in and outside of our community.
        </p>

        <h3>No Spamming or Trolling</h3>
        <p>
            Do not spam messages, links, or comments, and do not engage in trolling behavior. This includes any actions
            that disrupt the positive vibe of the community.
        </p>

        <h3>Privacy Matters</h3>
        <p>
            Respect the privacy of fellow community members. Do not share personal information without permission and be
            mindful of others’ boundaries.
        </p>

        <h3>Be Open to Feedback</h3>
        <p>
            Growth comes from learning. Be open to receiving constructive criticism and willing to offer it in a
            thoughtful, respectful way.
        </p>

        <h3>Zero Tolerance for Cheating or Exploits</h3>
        <p>
            Cheating, exploiting, or any form of dishonest play is strictly prohibited in any community events or
            tournaments. We value fair play and integrity above all else.
        </p>

        <h3>Have Fun and Stay Positive</h3>
        <p>
            Streaming should be enjoyable! Stay positive, have fun, and don’t forget to support one another. We’re all
            here to grow and succeed together.
        </p>

        <p class="warning">
            Violations of these rules can result in warnings, temporary suspension, or removal from the community,
            depending on the severity.
        </p>

        <p>
            By following these guidelines, we can ensure Darkened Minds remains a welcoming, uplifting, and
            growth-driven space for everyone!
